				<p>A Hong Kong NGO, Justice Centre, has interviewed over 1,000 foreign domestic workers in 2016.</p>
				<p><b>39%</b> of respondents said they did not have their own bedroom, and over <b>35%</b> shared a room with a child or an elderly individual.</p>
				<p>Besides, <b>2 in 3</b> workers have been working over 12 hours a day, way more than the globel benchmark, 8 hours for a 48-hour work week</p>

				<i><small><p>Taking the Minimum Allowable Wage for Foreign Domestic Workers, HK$4,110 (US$526.9) per month at the time the survey was conducted, this would translate to a salary of HK$14.39 (USD $1.85) an hour, <b>just equal to 44.3% of the minimum wage for local workers in Hong Kong</b>.
				<p>The Statutory Minimum Wage (for local workers only) is currently HK$32.50, although workers who earn this amount have to pay for their own food and accommodation from their earnings).</p></i></small>
